# Final Prototype 

*System*:

The basic functionality of the prototype is to send a reminder to other people through a mobile interface. This would be done by accesing the person's contactcs so it can notify the other person about their desire to communicate. Risk of Isolation  - Family member (both can be sender and both can be reciver)

One functionality additional is when someone at risk desires to be contacted it will send all the contacts a small notification.
 


* Additionally functionality:
  * For the frame option: Will be a clock displaying all the contacts that desire to be contacted through 3 medium of communications (text/ audio/ video), then the frame  will show the same options. TAfter that the interaction is ended untill its confirmed by the frame side
  * For the google assitant It enables audio output accesibility, (Might have day and night mode) this is based on the initial research 
 

*Additionally the system will provide the option to send a notification to all possible contacts
