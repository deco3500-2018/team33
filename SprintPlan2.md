# Sprint Plan 2

## Feedback 

> Feeback from tutor: Get information in relation to how long they communicate with their family and friends during each session
understand how long relationship are formed, during each method of the process 

## Plan
Refine Questionarie
Create a timer acurassy card to measure precise timing
Rationale
Pression will reveal wheter they are actually communicating properly

**Asumption**
Users do not remeber how long they communicate

## Focus

Needs to switch focus instead of problems of communication towards availability of it

## Plan

* Refine Questionarie
* Create first mid fidelity prototype
