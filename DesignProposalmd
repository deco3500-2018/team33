# Design Process -
Started with communities, our target audience was the elderly (45+) - Conducted more domain research: identified risk that lead to social isolation, then narrowed it down to social demographic risk - This is what we decided to go with. AND WHY? Health issues was hard to combat (expand more here).  Due to our domain being too broad. Health and experiencing loss.
Only had pure research - needed to look into communities. Lack of technology was assumption (VR was the initial drive) - they still had phones, it was more they didn't have people to use it - and where we moved away from VR. Providing a communication application through VR was our concept.
Moved towards an mobile application that notifies users that friends and family are active through interviews and questions conducted. Research wasn't there. Thinking of you was looked at. Talking about the similarities and the difference.
Questionnaire - Flopped 1st time, then reiterate to get more meaningful answers.
Started from the bottom now you're here (edited)
