# Initial requirements 

# Purpose Based on Isigths 
## MUST EXIST 2 Players
* Main purpose to help them connect with family and friends
* Secondary to help them reach out for new people usign social systems 


* Simple interface that does not require high connection 
* Applicatin need to be able to type, to record self visual and audio
* Does not need to be live
* Accesibility to application for people with disabilities such as low hearing 
* the possiblity to do it wearable or application
* people do find technology interesting and are willing to accept it given the proper documentation

## Functionality 

* Provide non real time communication to accomodate for distance
* Needs to provide all methods of input
* Accesibility

## POssible Ideas:
1. virtual reality (2 people and 2 cameras to show their point of view so they will be seeing what the other seeis ) chat formum that provides non-real time communication through different modes (text, audio/visual).
 
1. A VR world that enable people to having their second live inside. They can meeet new people or their friend or family inside the world. We may also include RPG inside the game in order to increase the possibility user communicate with each order.

1. a virtual recorder that enables sending messages capturing theiir enviroments plus audio but will only use image and sound  

Maybe 3rd idea isnt feasible 

## Diificulties with the ideas  

*  Creating authentic view, what other people sees and how they portray themselves

* Creation of a game, rpgs (Elderly playing games) or  simulate enviroments, keep focus on social isolation (HOw do we keep it playing at lest between 2p) 

* Differenciate with other apps, and very easy way of creator for an elderly person. make them feel they are with another person
